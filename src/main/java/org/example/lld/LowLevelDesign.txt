How to Design a Case Study?

Q. Give a single line problem statement

Design Solution:
1. Gather Requirements
2. Class Diagram
3. Schema Design
4. Write Code for some Classes/Interface


Machine Code Solution:
1. Clarify Requirements
2. Class Diagram
3. Schema Design
4. Complete End to End Code

Steps to Design a Case Study:

Step 0: Get an Overview
    1. Align your thoughts with the interviewer
    Case 1: You already know about the system - What you know align with Interviewer.
    Case 2: You don't know anything about the system - ask Interviewer to explain.

    2. What Exactly do you want me to design
        -> Entity Relationship Diagram
        -> Real Software System

    3. Do I have to persist the data in DB?
        3.1 -> Real DB
        3.2 -> In Memory DB

    4. How do I interact with the client? (Command Line || Rest API || Hard Code)

Step 1: Gather and Clarify Requirements
    1. Suggest some ideas/features and ask support if you need.
    2. 5-8 features is a good starting point.
    3. Write(Jot) down every point of requirements explained by Interviewer (Without asking again).
    4. Think About edge cases / future scope.

Note: While Gather Requirements don't over do and complicate by suggesting more features. unless Interviewer asks.

Step 2: Class Diagrams
    1. Visualizing the requirements(Entity) Outside and Inside of an Entity.
    2. Create (class/interface/enums) based on nouns.
    3. Use Design Patterns for that class if required?.

Step 3: Schema Design
    1. Create Tables based on Class Entities.
    2. Add Primitive Attributes to the table. (Unique)
    3. Add Non-Primitive Attributes to the table. (Non Unique)
    4. Add Foreign Keys to the table. (Provide Cardinality)

Step 4: Write Code
    1. Create a model for each entity.
